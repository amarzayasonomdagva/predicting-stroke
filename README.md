# predicting-stroke

Instruction:
Each numeric binary variable in the dataset takes the value 1 if the given ailment is present (like hypertension) and 0 if it is absent.
1. Considering how your model might be used ‘in real life’, construct the ‘best’ model given the data to predict a stroke. Justify each subjective choice you make in
identifying this model. 
2. Assume that the ‘cost’ of a false positive is C, and the ‘cost’ of a false negative is
10C. Identify the best possible model to predict a stroke. Justify your answer.

## My Approach

I explored relationships between variables closely and selected the most important ones to build my random forest model.
